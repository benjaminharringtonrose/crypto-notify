# Feature Analysis System Documentation

## Overview

The Feature Analysis System is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to systematically determine which features are beneficial for the Bitcoin trading model. This system addresses one of the most critical aspects of machine learning for trading: feature selection and optimization.

## Problem Statement

The current trading model uses **26 optimized features** (down from the original 36 features) based on systematic feature optimization experiments. The system has been optimized through gradual feature removal analysis to identify the most predictive features while eliminating noise.

## Components

### 1. Feature Analyzer (`analyzeFeatures.ts`)

**Purpose**: Statistical analysis of feature utility and redundancy

**Methods**:

- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson correlation between features and target variable
- **Statistical Significance**: T-tests to determine feature significance
- **Redundancy Analysis**: Inter-feature correlation matrix
- **Utility Scoring**: Combined utility and redundancy scores

**Output**:

- Feature rankings by correlation, significance, and utility
- Redundancy analysis showing highly correlated features
- Recommendations: "keep", "remove", or "investigate"

**Usage**:

```bash
npm run features:analyze
```

### 2. Feature Ablation Study (`featureAblationStudy.ts`)

**Purpose**: Measure impact of each feature on model performance

**Methods**:

- **Systematic Removal**: Train model with each feature removed individually
- **Performance Measurement**: Compare accuracy, returns, Sharpe ratio
- **Importance Scoring**: Calculate feature importance based on performance impact
- **Speed Analysis**: Measure training time improvements

**Output**:

- Feature importance rankings based on performance impact
- Critical features that significantly hurt performance when removed
- Potential noise features that improve performance when removed

**Usage**:

```bash
npm run features:ablation
```

### 3. Feature Set Optimizer (`optimizeFeatureSet.ts`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive optimization using multiple selection strategies

**Strategies**:

1. **Top Correlation**: Best features by correlation with target
2. **Top Importance**: Best features by ablation importance
3. **Balanced Category**: Representative features from each category
4. **Low Redundancy**: Features with minimal inter-correlation
5. **Utility Optimized**: High utility, manageable redundancy
6. **Conservative**: Features important in multiple analyses
7. **Minimal**: Bare essentials for maximum efficiency

**Process**:

1. Generate candidate feature subsets using different strategies
2. Train models with each subset
3. Evaluate performance, speed, and efficiency
4. Select optimal subset based on balanced scoring

**Output**:

- Optimal feature subset with performance metrics
- Comparison of all strategies
- Efficiency gains (speed, memory reduction)
- Specific recommendations for implementation

**Usage**:

```bash
npm run features:optimize
```

### 4. Feature Registry Fixer (`fixFeatureRegistry.ts`)

**Purpose**: Align FeatureRegistry with actual FeatureCalculator implementation

**Functions**:

- **Audit**: Compare registry vs actual implementation
- **Analysis**: Determine actual features produced by FeatureCalculator
- **Generation**: Create corrected FeatureRegistry code
- **Validation**: Verify alignment between components

**Output**:

- Corrected FeatureRegistry.ts code
- Feature mapping and categorization
- Validation results

**Usage**:

```bash
npm run features:fix-registry
```
