### **Baseline Established** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Result**: 58.24% validation accuracy, balanced F1 scores  
**Key Learning**: Found stable architecture that learns both classes  
**Next**: Begin Phase 1 experiments

### **Experiment #1: Threshold Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Change**: Threshold 0.001 ‚Üí 0.0015 (50% increase)  
**Hypothesis**: Higher threshold = better signal quality

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 58.51% (‚Üë0.27% vs baseline)
- **Best Combined Score**: 1.0941 vs 1.0410 (‚Üë5.1%)
- **Buy F1**: 0.5556 vs 0.5856 (‚Üì5.1%)
- **Sell F1**: 0.6081 vs 0.5388 (‚Üë12.9%)
- **Training Time**: 39.0s vs 59s (‚Üì34% faster!)

**Analysis**:
‚úÖ **Positive**: Faster training, higher sell precision, better combined score  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Mixed**: Slight accuracy improvement but less balanced F1 scores  
‚ùå **Negative**: Reduced buy signal detection

**Key Learning**: Higher threshold improves sell prediction but reduces buy sensitivity. The model becomes more conservative in buy predictions.

**Decision**: **ADOPT** - The overall improvement in combined score and training speed outweighs the buy F1 reduction.

### **Experiment #2: LSTM Capacity Increase** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
**Change**: LSTM units 64 ‚Üí 80 (25% increase)  
**Hypothesis**: More LSTM capacity = better pattern memory

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 53.19% vs 58.51% (‚Üì9.1% - MAJOR REGRESSION!)
- **Best Combined Score**: 0.9648 vs 1.0941 (‚Üì11.8%)
- **Buy F1**: 0.5652 vs 0.5556 (‚Üë1.7% - minimal improvement)
- **Sell F1**: 0.4688 vs 0.6081 (‚Üì22.9% - major degradation!)
- **Training Time**: 39.9s vs 39.0s (similar)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **MAJOR FAILURE**: Severe overfitting! Model learned to heavily favor buy class (84/10 split in epoch 1)  
‚ùå **Poor Generalization**: Best epoch was #2, then continuous degradation  
‚ùå **Imbalanced Learning**: Model lost ability to predict sell signals effectively

**Key Learning**: Our current dataset size (~600 days) cannot support LSTM capacity > 64 units. The sweet spot is 64 units for this amount of data.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Immediate revert to 64 units. This change caused severe overfitting.

### **Experiment #3: Conv1D Filter Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS  
**Change**: Conv1D filters 32 ‚Üí 48 (50% increase)  
**Hypothesis**: More filters = better feature extraction from price data

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 65.96% vs 58.51% (‚Üë12.7% - MAJOR IMPROVEMENT!)
- **Best Combined Score**: 1.2316 vs 1.0941 (‚Üë12.6%)
- **Buy F1**: 0.6815 vs 0.5556 (‚Üë22.7% - excellent improvement!)
- **Sell F1**: 0.6194 vs 0.6081 (‚Üë1.9% - maintained performance)
- **Training Time**: 39.1s vs 39.0s (identical)
- **Balanced Performance**: 57.5% balanced accuracy (‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë)

**Analysis**:
‚úÖ **MAJOR SUCCESS**: Significant improvement across all metrics!  
‚úÖ **Better Feature Extraction**: 48 filters capture more diverse patterns than 32  
‚úÖ **Maintained Balance**: Both buy and sell predictions improved  
‚úÖ **Best Performance Yet**: Combined score >1.2 for first time  
‚úÖ **Optimal Sweet Spot**: 48 filters seem to be the right capacity for our data

**Key Learning**: Conv1D filters are the bottleneck! Going from 32‚Üí48 filters dramatically improves the model's ability to extract meaningful features from crypto price patterns without overfitting.

**Decision**: **ADOPT** - This is our best improvement yet! 48 filters is the new baseline.

### **Experiment #4: Dense Layer Capacity Increase** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
**Change**: Dense layer units 32 ‚Üí 48 (50% increase)  
**Hypothesis**: More dense capacity = better pattern learning from improved Conv1D features

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 51.06% vs 65.96% (‚Üì22.6% - MAJOR REGRESSION!)
- **Best Combined Score**: 0.9263 vs 1.2316 (‚Üì24.8% - CATASTROPHIC!)
- **Buy F1**: 0.4323 vs 0.6815 (‚Üì36.6% - severe degradation!)
- **Sell F1**: 0.5639 vs 0.6194 (‚Üì9.0% - significant drop)
- **Training Time**: 42.0s vs 39.1s (similar)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**: Model completely lost ability to learn!  
‚ùå **Overfitting Crisis**: Best epoch was #1, then immediate degradation  
‚ùå **Severe Class Imbalance**: Model collapsed to predicting mostly sells (32/62 ‚Üí 8/86)  
‚ùå **No Learning**: Static patterns emerged, no improvement over 30 epochs

**Key Learning**: Dense layer capacity is very sensitive! Even going from 32‚Üí48 units (just +16) caused severe overfitting. Our current data/architecture can only support 32 dense units max.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Immediate revert to 32 units. This shows we've found the capacity limit.

### **Experiment #5: Dropout Rate Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
**Change**: Dropout rate 0.3 ‚Üí 0.2 (33% reduction)  
**Hypothesis**: Less regularization = better learning with our current capacity

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 52.13% vs 65.96% (‚Üì21.0% - MAJOR REGRESSION!)
- **Best Combined Score**: 0.8112 vs 1.2316 (‚Üì34.1% - SEVERE DROP!)
- **Buy F1**: 0.6364 vs 0.6815 (‚Üì6.6% - slight decline)
- **Sell F1**: 0.2437 vs 0.6194 (‚Üì60.7% - CATASTROPHIC!)
- **Training Time**: 43.0s vs 39.1s (similar)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **SEVERE IMBALANCE**: Model learned to heavily favor buy predictions (70/24 split)  
‚ùå **Sell Prediction Collapse**: Completely lost ability to predict sell signals  
‚ùå **Early Overfitting**: Best performance at epoch 1, then immediate degradation  
‚ùå **Poor Generalization**: Less dropout led to severe overfitting

**Key Learning**: Our current model architecture is perfectly tuned at 0.3 dropout rate. Even small reductions (0.3‚Üí0.2) cause immediate overfitting. The regularization is critical for generalization.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Revert to 0.3 dropout. This confirms our current config is optimal.

### **Experiment #6: Data Horizon Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MIXED RESULTS  
**Change**: Prediction horizon 1 day ‚Üí 2 days  
**Hypothesis**: Longer horizon = less noise, more meaningful patterns

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 59.09% vs 65.96% (‚Üì10.4% - regression)
- **Best Combined Score**: 1.0813 vs 1.2316 (‚Üì12.2% - decline)
- **Buy F1**: 0.6010 vs 0.6815 (‚Üì11.8% - moderate drop)
- **Sell F1**: 0.5497 vs 0.6194 (‚Üì11.3% - moderate drop)
- **Training Time**: 39.4s vs 39.1s (similar)
- **Matthews Correlation**: 0.0100 vs 0.1503 (‚Üì93.3% - much weaker)

**Analysis**:
‚ö†Ô∏è **MIXED OUTCOME**: Performance declined but learning was more stable  
‚úÖ **Better Balance**: More balanced buy/sell predictions (48/40 vs extreme splits)  
‚úÖ **Stable Learning**: Consistent improvement through training epochs  
‚ùå **Lower Peak Performance**: Maximum accuracy dropped significantly  
‚ùå **Weaker Patterns**: Much lower correlation suggests weaker signal

**Key Learning**: 2-day horizon provides more stable but weaker signals. The 1-day horizon, while noisier, contains stronger predictive patterns that our model can exploit more effectively.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Revert to 1-day horizon. The noise reduction doesn't compensate for the signal strength loss.

### **Experiment #7: Conv1D Kernel Size Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED (Both Variants)  
**Changes Tested**:

- **7A**: kernel_size 3 ‚Üí 5
- **7B**: kernel_size 3 ‚Üí 7

**Results Summary**:

- **Kernel 5**: 64.89% accuracy vs 65.96% baseline (‚Üì1.6%)
- **Kernel 7**: 57.45% accuracy vs 65.96% baseline (‚Üì12.9%)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **Clear Pattern**: Larger kernels consistently reduce performance  
‚ùå **Diminishing Returns**: Each kernel size increase worsens results  
‚ùå **Optimal Found**: kernel_size=3 is optimal for our crypto data patterns

**Key Learning**: Crypto price patterns operate on shorter time windows. Kernels larger than 3 dilute important short-term signals and reduce model effectiveness.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Kernel size 3 is optimal. Keep current configuration.

### **Experiment #8: Architecture Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
**Changes**: Conv1D "same" padding + LSTM input dropout (0.1)  
**Hypothesis**: Better sequence preservation + reduced LSTM overfitting

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 54.26% vs 65.96% (‚Üì17.7% - MAJOR REGRESSION!)
- **Best Combined Score**: 0.9709 vs 1.2316 (‚Üì21.2% - SEVERE DECLINE!)
- **Buy F1**: 0.5448 vs 0.6815 (‚Üì20.1% - major decline)
- **Sell F1**: 0.4958 vs 0.6194 (‚Üì20.0% - major decline)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **Severe Architecture Disruption**: Multiple changes caused performance collapse  
‚ùå **Same Padding Problem**: May have added noise instead of preserving information  
‚ùå **LSTM Input Dropout**: Reduced model's ability to learn sequential patterns

**Key Learning**: Our current architecture is highly optimized. Even "minor" changes like padding mode can severely disrupt performance.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Revert all changes. Current architecture is optimal.

### **Experiment #9: Batch Normalization Position** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
**Change**: BN before activation (Conv1D ‚Üí BN ‚Üí ReLU vs Conv1D+ReLU ‚Üí BN)  
**Hypothesis**: BN before activation improves gradient flow

**Results**:

- **Best Combined Score**: 1.0706 vs 1.2316 baseline (‚Üì13.1% regression!)
- **Best Validation Accuracy**: 57.45% vs 65.96% baseline (‚Üì12.9% major decline!)
- **Buy F1**: 0.6078 vs 0.6815 baseline (‚Üì10.8% decline)
- **Sell F1**: 0.3934 vs 0.6194 baseline (‚Üì36.5% severe decline!)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **Position Matters**: BN after activation works better for our architecture  
‚ùå **Severe Sell Prediction Loss**: Model lost ability to identify sell signals  
‚ùå **Training Instability**: Performance degraded despite more epochs (50 vs 30)

**Key Learning**: The standard BN placement (after activation) is optimal for crypto time series. Changing BN position disrupts the learned feature distribution.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Keep BN after activation. This confirms our current config is optimal.

### **Experiment #10: Learning Rate Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR DECLINE  
**Changes**: LR 0.0005‚Üí0.001, Min LR 0.00001‚Üí0.00005, Step Size 15‚Üí10  
**Hypothesis**: Wider LR range + faster cycling = better learning

**Results**:

- **Combined Score**: 1.2099 vs 1.2316 baseline (‚Üì1.8% - very minor decline)
- **Training Stability**: Good convergence, no major issues

**Analysis**:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Near Baseline**: Very close performance to our optimal settings  
‚úÖ **Stable Training**: No convergence issues with wider LR range  
‚ùå **Marginal Regression**: Slight performance decline shows baseline is better

**Key Learning**: Our current LR schedule is near-optimal. Small changes don't significantly help.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Revert to baseline LR settings for consistency.

### **Experiment #12: Focal Loss Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
**Changes**: Gamma 1.5‚Üí2.5, Alpha [0.4,0.6]‚Üí[0.3,0.7]  
**Hypothesis**: Stronger focus on hard examples + sell class bias

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 61.70% vs 65.96% baseline (‚Üì6.5% decline)
- **Combined Score**: 1.1372 vs 1.2316 baseline (‚Üì7.7% decline)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **Over-Focusing**: Too much emphasis on hard examples hurt overall learning  
‚ùå **Class Imbalance**: Stronger sell bias didn't improve performance

**Key Learning**: Our current focal loss parameters are well-tuned. Aggressive changes disrupt the learning balance.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Keep baseline focal loss settings.

### **CRITICAL FINDING: Epoch Count Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå CATASTROPHIC FAILURE  
**Change**: Epochs 30 ‚Üí 50  
**Hypothesis**: More training epochs = better convergence

**Results**:

- **50 epochs**: Combined Score 1.2161 vs 1.2316 baseline (‚Üì1.3%)
- **30 epochs (current)**: Combined Score 0.7395 vs 1.2316 baseline (‚Üì40.0% CATASTROPHIC!)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **SEVERE MODEL DEGRADATION**: Current baseline performing 40% worse than previous optimal  
‚ùå **Class Imbalance Crisis**: Model heavily biased toward "Buy" predictions (81/13 split)  
‚ùå **Sell Signal Loss**: Sell F1 dropped from 0.6194 to 0.2288 (‚Üì63.1%)  
‚ùå **Data Distribution Issues**: Validation accuracy dropped from 65.96% to 47.87%

**Key Learning**: Something fundamental has changed in our data or training process. The model has lost its ability to learn balanced predictions and is severely overfitting to the buy class.

**Decision**: **CRITICAL** - Investigation needed. Current model performance is unacceptable.

### **INVESTIGATION RESULT: Threshold Optimization Critical Fix** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚úÖ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH  
**Root Cause**: Threshold 0.0015 was causing severe class imbalance in raw data  
**Fix**: Revert threshold 0.0015 ‚Üí 0.001

**Results**:

- **Before Fix**: Combined Score 0.7395, Val Accuracy 47.87%, Buy/Sell 81/13 (severe imbalance)
- **After Fix**: Combined Score 1.1082, Val Accuracy 60.44%, Buy/Sell 42/49 (balanced)
- **Improvement**: +41.6% combined score, +26.2% validation accuracy!

**Analysis**:
‚úÖ **Root Cause Identified**: Higher threshold (0.0015) created class imbalance before dataset balancing  
‚úÖ **Class Balance Restored**: Now seeing proper buy/sell distribution in predictions  
‚úÖ **Learning Restored**: Model can properly learn both buy and sell signals  
‚úÖ **Performance Recovery**: Back to acceptable performance levels

**Key Learning**: Threshold selection is CRITICAL for class balance. Even small changes (0.001‚Üí0.0015) can destroy model learning by creating severe data imbalance that overwhelms the balancing algorithm.

**Decision**: **ADOPT** - Keep threshold at 0.001. This is our new working baseline for further experiments.

### **Experiment NEW-1: Conv1D Filter Scaling** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
**Change**: Conv1D filters 48 ‚Üí 56 (17% increase)  
**Hypothesis**: More filters = better feature extraction to push past 60% accuracy

**Results**:

- **Best Combined Score**: 0.9406 vs 1.1082 baseline (‚Üì15.1% major regression)
- **Best Validation Accuracy**: 51.65% vs 60.44% baseline (‚Üì14.5% decline)
- **Buy F1**: 0.5059 vs 0.5867 baseline (‚Üì13.8% decline)
- **Sell F1**: 0.5042 vs 0.5908 baseline (‚Üì14.7% decline)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **Capacity Limit Confirmed**: 48 filters is indeed the optimal for our data size  
‚ùå **Overfitting Pattern**: Higher capacity consistently reduces performance  
‚ùå **Diminishing Returns**: Each increase beyond 48 filters hurts all metrics

**Key Learning**: Conv1D filter capacity of 48 is a hard limit for our dataset. Any increase causes overfitting and performance degradation across all metrics.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Keep 48 Conv1D filters as optimal.

### **Experiment NEW-2: Learning Rate Fine-tuning** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MIXED RESULTS  
**Change**: Initial learning rate 0.0005 ‚Üí 0.0008 (60% increase)  
**Hypothesis**: Higher LR = better convergence and faster learning

**Results**:

- **Best Combined Score**: 1.1043 vs 1.1082 baseline (‚Üì0.4% minimal decline)
- **Best Validation Accuracy**: 60.44% vs 60.44% baseline (identical performance!)
- **Buy F1**: 0.5377 vs 0.5867 baseline (‚Üì8.4% decline)
- **Sell F1**: 0.6364 vs 0.5908 baseline (‚Üë7.7% improvement!)

**Analysis**:
‚ö†Ô∏è **INTERESTING TRADE-OFF**: Same validation accuracy but different F1 balance  
‚úÖ **Sell Performance Boost**: +7.7% improvement in sell predictions  
‚ùå **Buy Performance Drop**: -8.4% decline in buy predictions  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Neutral Overall**: Combined score nearly identical

**Key Learning**: Learning rate affects prediction balance. Higher LR (0.0008) favors sell predictions, baseline LR (0.0005) favors buy predictions. Both achieve same validation accuracy.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Keep 0.0005 LR for balanced predictions, but this suggests LR tuning could be useful for specific trading strategies.

### **Experiment NEW-3: Multi-Scale Conv1D Architecture** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå CATASTROPHIC FAILURE  
**Change**: Single Conv1D(48,3) ‚Üí Parallel [Conv1D(16,3) + Conv1D(16,5) + Conv1D(16,7)] ‚Üí Concatenate  
**Hypothesis**: Different kernel sizes capture different temporal patterns in parallel

**Results**:

- **Best Combined Score**: 0.8118 vs 1.1082 baseline (‚Üì26.7% CATASTROPHIC!)
- **Best Validation Accuracy**: 45.05% vs 60.44% baseline (‚Üì25.5% MAJOR FAILURE!)
- **Buy F1**: 0.3890 vs 0.5867 baseline (‚Üì33.7% severe decline)
- **Sell F1**: 0.4929 vs 0.5908 baseline (‚Üì16.6% major decline)
- **Early Stopping**: At epoch 11 due to severe class imbalance

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **Complete Architecture Failure**: Multi-scale approach completely disrupted learning  
‚ùå **Class Imbalance Crisis**: Model collapsed to 89/2 buy/sell predictions by epoch 10  
‚ùå **Parameter Distribution Issues**: Splitting 48 filters across branches may have reduced individual branch capacity  
‚ùå **Complexity vs Data**: Parallel architecture too complex for current dataset size

**Key Learning**: Our dataset cannot support complex parallel architectures. Simple, focused architectures work better than sophisticated multi-branch designs for crypto time series.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Revert to single Conv1D. Multi-scale approaches are not suitable for our data complexity.

### **Experiment NEW-4: Lightweight Attention Mechanism** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
**Change**: LSTM returnSequences=false ‚Üí true + GlobalAveragePooling1D  
**Hypothesis**: Attention helps model focus on important time steps

**Results**:

- **Best Combined Score**: 1.0531 vs 1.1082 baseline (‚Üì5.0% decline)
- **Best Validation Accuracy**: 58.24% vs 60.44% baseline (‚Üì3.6% regression)
- **Buy F1**: 0.6548 vs 0.5867 baseline (‚Üë11.6% improvement!)
- **Sell F1**: 0.4676 vs 0.5908 baseline (‚Üì20.9% major decline!)
- **Class Imbalance**: 64/27 buy/sell split showing bias

**Analysis**:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Mixed Results**: Improved buy predictions but destroyed sell predictions  
‚ùå **Class Bias**: Model learned to favor buy class heavily  
‚ùå **Overall Decline**: Net performance decrease despite buy improvement  
‚úÖ **Architecture Intact**: No catastrophic failure like multi-scale

**Key Learning**: Simple attention (GlobalAveragePooling1D) disrupts the balanced learning our LSTM achieved. The sequential nature of returnSequences=false works better for our binary classification task.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Revert to baseline LSTM. Current LSTM configuration is optimal for balanced predictions.

### **Experiment NEW-5: Feature Set Analysis** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
**Change**: Analyzed current 62-feature implementation vs baseline  
**Hypothesis**: Rich technical indicators should improve performance

**Results**:

- **Best Combined Score**: 1.0131 vs 1.1082 baseline (‚Üì8.6% decline)
- **Best Validation Accuracy**: 56.04% vs 60.44% baseline (‚Üì7.3% regression)
- **Buy F1**: 0.5957 vs 0.5867 baseline (‚Üë1.5% slight improvement)
- **Sell F1**: 0.4869 vs 0.5908 baseline (‚Üì17.6% significant decline)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **Feature Overload**: 62 features added more noise than signal  
‚ùå **Class Imbalance**: Complex features disrupted balanced learning  
‚ùå **Overfitting**: Too many features for our dataset size (600 days)  
‚úÖ **Insight Found**: Need feature reduction, not feature addition

**Key Learning**: More features ‚â† better performance. Our extensive technical indicator set was counterproductive, suggesting feature noise was overwhelming the model's ability to learn meaningful patterns.

**Decision**: **REJECT** current feature set - Need to reduce and optimize features.

### **Experiment NEW-6: Core Feature Set Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚úÖ MAJOR SUCCESS  
**Change**: Reduced 62 features ‚Üí 25 core indicators focused on trader essentials  
**Hypothesis**: Less noise + domain-focused features = better performance

**Core Feature Set (25 features)**:

- **Price Action**: Current price, previous price, price change %
- **Trend**: SMA 7/21/50, price/SMA ratios
- **Momentum**: RSI, MACD line/signal, MACD histogram
- **Volatility**: ATR, Bollinger Bands, BB position
- **Volume**: Volume, volume MA, VWAP, volume ratio

**Results**:

- **Best Combined Score**: 1.1293 vs 1.1082 baseline (‚Üë1.9% improvement!)
- **Best Validation Accuracy**: 60.44% vs 60.44% baseline (matched best performance!)
- **Buy F1**: 0.5646 vs 0.5867 baseline (‚Üì3.8% slight decline)
- **Sell F1**: 0.6341 vs 0.5908 baseline (‚Üë7.3% improvement!)
- **Training Time**: 31.6s vs 40s baseline (‚Üì21% faster!)
- **Model Size**: 34.8K vs 46K parameters (‚Üì24% smaller!)

**Analysis**:
‚úÖ **BREAKTHROUGH**: Reduced features dramatically improved efficiency while maintaining performance  
‚úÖ **Better Balance**: Improved sell predictions (0.6341 vs 0.5908 F1)  
‚úÖ **Training Efficiency**: 21% faster training, 24% fewer parameters  
‚úÖ **Domain Focus**: Core trading indicators provide sufficient signal  
‚úÖ **Noise Reduction**: Removing 37 redundant features eliminated confusion

**Key Learning**: **"Less is More"** - 25 well-chosen features outperform 62 complex indicators. Domain knowledge (trader-used indicators) beats feature engineering complexity. Quality > Quantity in feature selection.

**Decision**: **ADOPT** - Core feature set (25 features) is our new optimal baseline. This represents a major breakthrough in model efficiency and clarity.
