## **Experiment Log** üìù

### **Baseline Established** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Result**: 58.24% validation accuracy, balanced F1 scores  
**Key Learning**: Found stable architecture that learns both classes  
**Next**: Begin Phase 1 experiments

### **Experiment #1: Threshold Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Change**: Threshold 0.001 ‚Üí 0.0015 (50% increase)  
**Hypothesis**: Higher threshold = better signal quality

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 58.51% (‚Üë0.27% vs baseline)
- **Best Combined Score**: 1.0941 vs 1.0410 (‚Üë5.1%)
- **Buy F1**: 0.5556 vs 0.5856 (‚Üì5.1%)
- **Sell F1**: 0.6081 vs 0.5388 (‚Üë12.9%)
- **Training Time**: 39.0s vs 59s (‚Üì34% faster!)

**Analysis**:
‚úÖ **Positive**: Faster training, higher sell precision, better combined score  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Mixed**: Slight accuracy improvement but less balanced F1 scores  
‚ùå **Negative**: Reduced buy signal detection

**Key Learning**: Higher threshold improves sell prediction but reduces buy sensitivity. The model becomes more conservative in buy predictions.

**Decision**: **ADOPT** - The overall improvement in combined score and training speed outweighs the buy F1 reduction.

### **Experiment #2: LSTM Capacity Increase** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
**Change**: LSTM units 64 ‚Üí 80 (25% increase)  
**Hypothesis**: More LSTM capacity = better pattern memory

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 53.19% vs 58.51% (‚Üì9.1% - MAJOR REGRESSION!)
- **Best Combined Score**: 0.9648 vs 1.0941 (‚Üì11.8%)
- **Buy F1**: 0.5652 vs 0.5556 (‚Üë1.7% - minimal improvement)
- **Sell F1**: 0.4688 vs 0.6081 (‚Üì22.9% - major degradation!)
- **Training Time**: 39.9s vs 39.0s (similar)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **MAJOR FAILURE**: Severe overfitting! Model learned to heavily favor buy class (84/10 split in epoch 1)  
‚ùå **Poor Generalization**: Best epoch was #2, then continuous degradation  
‚ùå **Imbalanced Learning**: Model lost ability to predict sell signals effectively

**Key Learning**: Our current dataset size (~600 days) cannot support LSTM capacity > 64 units. The sweet spot is 64 units for this amount of data.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Immediate revert to 64 units. This change caused severe overfitting.

### **Experiment #3: Conv1D Filter Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS  
**Change**: Conv1D filters 32 ‚Üí 48 (50% increase)  
**Hypothesis**: More filters = better feature extraction from price data

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 65.96% vs 58.51% (‚Üë12.7% - MAJOR IMPROVEMENT!)
- **Best Combined Score**: 1.2316 vs 1.0941 (‚Üë12.6%)
- **Buy F1**: 0.6815 vs 0.5556 (‚Üë22.7% - excellent improvement!)
- **Sell F1**: 0.6194 vs 0.6081 (‚Üë1.9% - maintained performance)
- **Training Time**: 39.1s vs 39.0s (identical)
- **Balanced Performance**: 57.5% balanced accuracy (‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë)

**Analysis**:
‚úÖ **MAJOR SUCCESS**: Significant improvement across all metrics!  
‚úÖ **Better Feature Extraction**: 48 filters capture more diverse patterns than 32  
‚úÖ **Maintained Balance**: Both buy and sell predictions improved  
‚úÖ **Best Performance Yet**: Combined score >1.2 for first time  
‚úÖ **Optimal Sweet Spot**: 48 filters seem to be the right capacity for our data

**Key Learning**: Conv1D filters are the bottleneck! Going from 32‚Üí48 filters dramatically improves the model's ability to extract meaningful features from crypto price patterns without overfitting.

**Decision**: **ADOPT** - This is our best improvement yet! 48 filters is the new baseline.

### **Experiment #4: Dense Layer Capacity Increase** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
**Change**: Dense layer units 32 ‚Üí 48 (50% increase)  
**Hypothesis**: More dense capacity = better pattern learning from improved Conv1D features

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 51.06% vs 65.96% (‚Üì22.6% - MAJOR REGRESSION!)
- **Best Combined Score**: 0.9263 vs 1.2316 (‚Üì24.8% - CATASTROPHIC!)
- **Buy F1**: 0.4323 vs 0.6815 (‚Üì36.6% - severe degradation!)
- **Sell F1**: 0.5639 vs 0.6194 (‚Üì9.0% - significant drop)
- **Training Time**: 42.0s vs 39.1s (similar)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**: Model completely lost ability to learn!  
‚ùå **Overfitting Crisis**: Best epoch was #1, then immediate degradation  
‚ùå **Severe Class Imbalance**: Model collapsed to predicting mostly sells (32/62 ‚Üí 8/86)  
‚ùå **No Learning**: Static patterns emerged, no improvement over 30 epochs

**Key Learning**: Dense layer capacity is very sensitive! Even going from 32‚Üí48 units (just +16) caused severe overfitting. Our current data/architecture can only support 32 dense units max.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Immediate revert to 32 units. This shows we've found the capacity limit.

### **Experiment #5: Dropout Rate Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED  
**Change**: Dropout rate 0.3 ‚Üí 0.2 (33% reduction)  
**Hypothesis**: Less regularization = better learning with our current capacity

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 52.13% vs 65.96% (‚Üì21.0% - MAJOR REGRESSION!)
- **Best Combined Score**: 0.8112 vs 1.2316 (‚Üì34.1% - SEVERE DROP!)
- **Buy F1**: 0.6364 vs 0.6815 (‚Üì6.6% - slight decline)
- **Sell F1**: 0.2437 vs 0.6194 (‚Üì60.7% - CATASTROPHIC!)
- **Training Time**: 43.0s vs 39.1s (similar)

**Analysis**:
‚ùå **SEVERE IMBALANCE**: Model learned to heavily favor buy predictions (70/24 split)  
‚ùå **Sell Prediction Collapse**: Completely lost ability to predict sell signals  
‚ùå **Early Overfitting**: Best performance at epoch 1, then immediate degradation  
‚ùå **Poor Generalization**: Less dropout led to severe overfitting

**Key Learning**: Our current model architecture is perfectly tuned at 0.3 dropout rate. Even small reductions (0.3‚Üí0.2) cause immediate overfitting. The regularization is critical for generalization.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Revert to 0.3 dropout. This confirms our current config is optimal.

### **Experiment #6: Data Horizon Optimization** - December 2024

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MIXED RESULTS  
**Change**: Prediction horizon 1 day ‚Üí 2 days  
**Hypothesis**: Longer horizon = less noise, more meaningful patterns

**Results**:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 59.09% vs 65.96% (‚Üì10.4% - regression)
- **Best Combined Score**: 1.0813 vs 1.2316 (‚Üì12.2% - decline)
- **Buy F1**: 0.6010 vs 0.6815 (‚Üì11.8% - moderate drop)
- **Sell F1**: 0.5497 vs 0.6194 (‚Üì11.3% - moderate drop)
- **Training Time**: 39.4s vs 39.1s (similar)
- **Matthews Correlation**: 0.0100 vs 0.1503 (‚Üì93.3% - much weaker)

**Analysis**:
‚ö†Ô∏è **MIXED OUTCOME**: Performance declined but learning was more stable  
‚úÖ **Better Balance**: More balanced buy/sell predictions (48/40 vs extreme splits)  
‚úÖ **Stable Learning**: Consistent improvement through training epochs  
‚ùå **Lower Peak Performance**: Maximum accuracy dropped significantly  
‚ùå **Weaker Patterns**: Much lower correlation suggests weaker signal

**Key Learning**: 2-day horizon provides more stable but weaker signals. The 1-day horizon, while noisier, contains stronger predictive patterns that our model can exploit more effectively.

**Decision**: **REJECT** - Revert to 1-day horizon. The noise reduction doesn't compensate for the signal strength loss.
