# Model Performance Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the cryptocurrency trading model to address overfitting, class imbalance, and performance issues identified during training and backtesting.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Severe Overfitting

- **Problem**: Training accuracy reached ~0.96 while validation accuracy stayed around 0.55-0.75
- **Impact**: Large spread between training and validation performance (0.20+)
- **Root Cause**: Model too complex for dataset size, aggressive regularization

### 2. Class Imbalance Bias

- **Problem**: Model initially predicted only "Buy" signals on validation set
- **Impact**: `val_customF1Sell` started at 0.00 for many epochs
- **Root Cause**: Poor class balancing, aggressive focal loss parameters

### 3. Strategy Distribution Logging Bug

- **Problem**: Backtest showed `NaN trades` in strategy distribution
- **Impact**: Inaccurate strategy performance analysis
- **Root Cause**: Key mismatch between StrategyType enum and logging keys

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Model Architecture Optimization

#### Reduced Model Complexity

- **Conv1D Filters**: Reduced from 12/24 to 8/16
- **LSTM Units**: Reduced from 48/24 to 32/16
- **Dense Units**: Reduced from 24 to 16
- **Time Distributed Units**: Reduced from 16 to 12

#### Enhanced Regularization

- **L2 Regularization**: Reduced from 0.015 to 0.01
- **Dropout Rate**: Reduced from 0.6 to 0.4
- **Added Batch Normalization**: After each major layer for better training stability
- **Recurrent Regularization**: Added L2 regularization to LSTM recurrent weights

#### Better Initialization

- **Kernel Initializer**: Changed from orthogonal to heNormal for better performance
- **Added Dropout**: After convolutional layers (0.2 rate)

### 2. Training Process Improvements

#### Enhanced Learning Rate Management

- **Initial Learning Rate**: Increased from 0.0004 to 0.001
- **Minimum Learning Rate**: Reduced from 0.00005 to 0.00001
- **LR Decay Rate**: Reduced from 0.99 to 0.95 for faster adaptation
- **Warmup Epochs**: Reduced from 10 to 5

#### Better Data Handling

- **Batch Size**: Reduced from 128 to 64 for better generalization
- **Train Split**: Increased from 0.7 to 0.8 for more training data
- **Patience**: Reduced from 25 to 15 for earlier stopping

#### Improved Loss Function

- **Focal Loss Gamma**: Reduced from 3.0 to 2.0 for less aggressive focus
- **Class Weights**: Balanced from [0.35, 0.65] to [0.4, 0.6]

### 3. Data Preprocessing Enhancements

#### Advanced Class Balancing

- **SMOTE-like Oversampling**: Implemented for minority class
- **Data Augmentation**: Added 2 augmented samples per minority class sample
- **Robust Shuffling**: Proper dataset shuffling after balancing

#### Feature Scaling Improvements

- **Robust Standard Deviation**: Better handling of outliers
- **Minimum Std Threshold**: Set to 0.01 to prevent division by zero
- **Maximum Std Clipping**: Capped at 10 to prevent extreme values

#### Noise Reduction

- **Reduced Noise Amplitude**: From 0.05 to 0.02
- **Smaller Scaling Variations**: From 0.2 to 0.1

### 4. Evaluation Metrics Enhancement

#### Comprehensive Metrics

- **Balanced Accuracy**: Average of buy and sell recall
- **Matthews Correlation Coefficient**: Better measure for imbalanced datasets
- **Robust Confusion Matrix**: Clear visualization of predictions

#### Error Handling

- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Added to all metric calculations
- **Increased Epsilon**: From 1e-6 to 1e-8 for numerical stability
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to safe values on errors

### 5. Early Stopping and Best Weights

#### Multi-Metric Tracking

- **Combined Score**: Balances F1 scores and validation loss
- **Early Stopping**: Based on validation loss improvement
- **Patience Counter**: Prevents overtraining

#### Weight Management

- **Best Weights Storage**: Based on combined performance metrics
- **Automatic Restoration**: Restores best weights at training end

## Expected Results

### Training Performance

- **Reduced Overfitting**: Validation accuracy should be closer to training accuracy
- **Better Class Balance**: Both buy and sell predictions should improve from early epochs
- **Faster Convergence**: Early stopping should prevent unnecessary training

### Validation Metrics

- **Improved F1 Scores**: Both buy and sell should show consistent improvement
- **Balanced Performance**: Recall and precision should be more balanced between classes
- **Lower Spread**: Training vs validation accuracy gap should be reduced

### Backtesting Results

- **Fixed Strategy Logging**: No more NaN trades in strategy distribution
- **Better Strategy Performance**: More balanced strategy selection
- **Improved Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Better Sharpe ratios and lower drawdowns

## Implementation Notes

### New Model Architecture

The model now includes batch normalization after each major layer:

- `bn_conv1`, `bn_conv2`: After convolutional layers
- `bn_lstm1`, `bn_lstm2`, `bn_lstm3`: After LSTM layers
- `bn_dense1`: After first dense layer

### Weight Saving

All new batch normalization layers are properly saved and loaded:

- Gamma, Beta, Moving Mean, Moving Variance for each BN layer

### Data Augmentation

Minority class samples are augmented with:

- Small random noise (±0.02)
- Minor scaling variations (±0.1)

## Next Steps

1. **Retrain Model**: Run `npm run train` with new configuration
2. **Validate Improvements**: Check for reduced overfitting and better class balance
3. **Backtest Results**: Verify strategy distribution logging is fixed
4. **Performance Analysis**: Compare new metrics with previous results
5. **Fine-tuning**: Adjust hyperparameters based on new training results

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch

- **Validation Loss**: Should decrease consistently
- **F1 Score Spread**: Buy vs Sell F1 should be more balanced
- **Accuracy Spread**: Training vs Validation gap should be <0.15
- **Early Stopping**: Should trigger around epoch 40-60

### Warning Signs

- **High Overfitting**: If spread remains >0.20
- **Class Imbalance**: If one class F1 score remains very low
- **Slow Convergence**: If validation metrics don't improve for >20 epochs
