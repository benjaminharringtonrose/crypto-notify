# Train Script Documentation

## Overview

The `train.ts` script is a streamlined training utility that initializes and executes the machine learning model training process for the Cardano trading system. It provides a simple, single-purpose interface for training neural network models that will be used for cryptocurrency price prediction and trading decision making.

## Purpose

The script serves as the primary entry point for model training operations, providing:

- **Model Initialization**: Creates and configures the TradeModelTrainer instance
- **Training Execution**: Initiates the complete training pipeline
- **Simplified Interface**: Single command execution for training operations
- **Integration Point**: Connects training functionality with the broader system

## Architecture

```
Train Script → TradeModelTrainer → Training Pipeline → Model Output

```

### Key Components

- **Script Entry Point**: Simple execution interface
- **Trainer Integration**: Direct integration with TradeModelTrainer class
- **Training Orchestration**: Delegates training logic to specialized trainer
- **Model Output**: Produces trained models for deployment

## Script Structure

### Main Execution Flow

```typescript
import { TradeModelTrainer } from "../cardano/TradeModelTrainer";

const trainer = new TradeModelTrainer();

trainer.train();
```

**Execution Steps**:
1. **Import**: Load the TradeModelTrainer class
2. **Instantiation**: Create trainer instance with default configuration
3. **Training**: Execute the complete training process
4. **Completion**: Training completes and model is ready for use

### Code Analysis

The script is intentionally minimal, following the principle of separation of concerns:

```typescript
// Single import for trainer functionality
import { TradeModelTrainer } from "../cardano/TradeModelTrainer";

// Direct instantiation with default constructor
const trainer = new TradeModelTrainer();

// Simple method call to start training
trainer.train();
```

**Design Principles**:
- **Simplicity**: Minimal code for maximum clarity
- **Delegation**: Training logic handled by specialized trainer class
- **Configuration**: Uses default trainer configuration
- **Single Responsibility**: Script focuses solely on training execution

## TradeModelTrainer Integration
