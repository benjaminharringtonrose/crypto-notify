# Technical Indicator Experimentation Prompt

## üéØ Objective

**Systematically experiment with 5 new technical indicators** to improve our Bitcoin trading model performance using the gradual feature optimization script. **Keep any indicator that improves the model and move on to the next experiment.**

## üìä Current Context

- **Model**: Conv1D(48,3) ‚Üí BN ‚Üí Dropout(0.3) ‚Üí LSTM(64) ‚Üí Dense(32) ‚Üí Dropout(0.3) ‚Üí Output(2)
- **Current Features**: 31 optimized features (up from 26 original)
- **Performance Target**: Improve combined F1 score, validation accuracy, and balanced accuracy
- **Tolerance**: 2% performance improvement threshold
- **Prediction Horizon**: 7 days out

## üîß Implementation Requirements

### 1. **New Indicator Integration**

- Add the new technical indicator to `FeatureCalculator.ts` in the `compute` method
- Add corresponding feature definition to `FeatureRegistry.ts`
- Ensure the indicator is added to the `optimizedFeatures` array
- Update the feature count in `FeatureDetector.ts` if needed

### 2. **Testing Process**

Use the gradual feature optimization script to test the new indicator:

```bash
# Test the new indicator specifically
npm run features:gradual -- --feature "newIndicatorName"

# Or test all features including the new one
npm run features:gradual
```

### 3. **Performance Evaluation Criteria**

Keep the new indicator if it meets ANY of these criteria:

- **Combined F1 Score**: Improves by >2%
- **Validation Accuracy**: Improves by >2%
- **Balanced Accuracy**: Improves by >2%
- **Matthews Correlation**: Improves by >2%
- **Sell F1 Score**: Improves significantly (addresses current imbalance)

## üìà **ROUND 3: 5 NEW INDICATORS FOR 7-DAY PREDICTION**

Based on analysis for 7-day prediction capabilities, these indicators are selected for their trend-following and momentum characteristics:

### **1. Average Directional Index (ADX)** - Trend Strength

- **Status**: Not implemented yet
- **Expected Benefit**: Measures trend strength, crucial for 7-day predictions
- **Implementation**: Add `calculateADX()` method and integrate
- **7-Day Relevance**: Strong trends are more likely to continue over longer periods

### **2. Ichimoku Cloud** - Trend & Support/Resistance

- **Status**: Not implemented yet
- **Expected Benefit**: Comprehensive trend analysis with multiple timeframes
- **Implementation**: Add `calculateIchimoku()` method and integrate
- **7-Day Relevance**: Cloud levels provide strong support/resistance for longer predictions

### **3. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)** - Price Action

- **Status**: Not implemented yet
- **Expected Benefit**: Volume-weighted price levels that act as dynamic support/resistance
- **Implementation**: Add `calculateVWAP()` method and integrate
- **7-Day Relevance**: VWAP levels are significant for longer-term price movements

### **4. Fibonacci Retracement** - Support/Resistance

- **Status**: Not implemented yet
- **Expected Benefit**: Natural support/resistance levels based on Fibonacci ratios
- **Implementation**: Add `calculateFibonacciLevels()` method and integrate
- **7-Day Relevance**: Fibonacci levels often act as reversal points over longer periods

### **5. On-Balance Volume (OBV)** - Volume Trend

- **Status**: Not implemented yet
- **Expected Benefit**: Volume-based trend confirmation, leading indicator
- **Implementation**: Add `calculateOBV()` method and integrate
- **7-Day Relevance**: Volume trends often precede price trends by several days

## üéØ **EXPERIMENTATION PROCESS**

**For each of the 5 indicators:**

1. **Research the indicator**: Explain its calculation, interpretation, and typical use cases
2. **Implement the indicator**: Add it to FeatureCalculator.ts and FeatureRegistry.ts
3. **Test with gradual optimization**: Use the script to evaluate performance impact
4. **Analyze results**: Compare before/after metrics and make recommendation
5. **If beneficial**: Keep the indicator and update the optimized feature set
6. **If not beneficial**: Revert changes and explain why it didn't work
7. **Move to next indicator**: Continue with the next indicator in the list
