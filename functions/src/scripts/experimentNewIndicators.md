# Technical Indicator Experimentation Prompt

## üéØ Objective

**Systematically experiment with 5 new technical indicators** to improve our Bitcoin trading model performance using the gradual feature optimization script. **Keep any indicator that improves the model and move on to the next experiment.**

## üìä Current Context

- **Model**: Conv1D(48,3) ‚Üí BN ‚Üí Dropout(0.3) ‚Üí LSTM(64) ‚Üí Dense(32) ‚Üí Dropout(0.3) ‚Üí Output(2)
- **Current Features**: 28 optimized features (up from 26 original)
- **Performance Target**: Improve combined F1 score, validation accuracy, and balanced accuracy
- **Tolerance**: 2% performance improvement threshold

## üîß Implementation Requirements

### 1. **New Indicator Integration**

- Add the new technical indicator to `FeatureCalculator.ts` in the `compute` method
- Add corresponding feature definition to `FeatureRegistry.ts`
- Ensure the indicator is added to the `optimizedFeatures` array
- Update the feature count in `FeatureDetector.ts` if needed

### 2. **Testing Process**

Use the gradual feature optimization script to test the new indicator:

```bash
# Test the new indicator specifically
npm run features:gradual -- --feature "newIndicatorName"

# Or test all features including the new one
npm run features:gradual
```

### 3. **Performance Evaluation Criteria**

Keep the new indicator if it meets ANY of these criteria:

- **Combined F1 Score**: Improves by >2%
- **Validation Accuracy**: Improves by >2%
- **Balanced Accuracy**: Improves by >2%
- **Matthews Correlation**: Improves by >2%
- **Sell F1 Score**: Improves significantly (addresses current imbalance)

## üìà **ROUND 1 RESULTS (COMPLETED)**

### **Previous 5 Experiments Summary:**

1. **Stochastic RSI (StochRSI)** - ‚ùå **REMOVED** (mixed results, no clear improvement)
2. **Commodity Channel Index (CCI)** - ‚úÖ **KEPT** (massive 39.05% decline in Buy F1 when removed)
3. **Money Flow Index (MFI)** - ‚úÖ **KEPT** (massive 24.37% decline in Buy F1 when removed)
4. **Keltner Channels** - ‚ùå **REMOVED** (1.99% improvement in Combined F1 when removed)
5. **Aroon Oscillator** - ‚úÖ **KEPT** (massive 32.38% decline in Sell F1 when removed)

### **Current Feature Set:**

- **Total Features**: 28 (up from 26 original)
- **New Features Added**: CCI, MFI, Aroon Oscillator
- **Features Removed**: Keltner Channels

## üìà **ROUND 2: 5 NEW INDICATORS FOR EXPERIMENTATION**

Based on analysis of current feature set, these indicators are available but not in optimized features:

### **1. Williams %R** - Momentum

- **Status**: Already implemented in `calculateWilliamsR()` but not in optimized features
- **Expected Benefit**: Momentum oscillator that measures overbought/oversold levels
- **Implementation**: Add `indicators.williamsR` to optimized features

### **2. Donchian Channels** - Volatility

- **Status**: Not implemented yet
- **Expected Benefit**: Volatility-based support/resistance levels using highest highs and lowest lows
- **Implementation**: Add `calculateDonchianChannels()` method and integrate

### **3. Parabolic SAR** - Trend

- **Status**: Not implemented yet
- **Expected Benefit**: Trend following indicator that provides stop-loss levels
- **Implementation**: Add `calculateParabolicSAR()` method and integrate

### **4. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)** - Volume

- **Status**: Not implemented yet
- **Expected Benefit**: Volume-weighted indicator that measures buying/selling pressure
- **Implementation**: Add `calculateCMF()` method and integrate

### **5. Rate of Change (ROC)** - Momentum

- **Status**: Not implemented yet
- **Expected Benefit**: Momentum indicator that measures price change over time
- **Implementation**: Add `calculateROC()` method and integrate

## üéØ **EXPERIMENTATION PROCESS**

**For each of the 5 indicators:**

1. **Research the indicator**: Explain its calculation, interpretation, and typical use cases
2. **Implement the indicator**: Add it to FeatureCalculator.ts and FeatureRegistry.ts
3. **Test with gradual optimization**: Use the script to evaluate performance impact
4. **Analyze results**: Compare before/after metrics and make recommendation
5. **If beneficial**: Keep the indicator and update the optimized feature set
6. **If not beneficial**: Revert changes and explain why it didn't work
7. **Move to next indicator**: Continue with the next indicator in the list
