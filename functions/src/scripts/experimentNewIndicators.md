# Technical Indicator Experimentation Prompt

## 🎯 Objective

**Systematically experiment with 5 new technical indicators** to improve our Bitcoin trading model performance using the gradual feature optimization script. **Keep any indicator that improves the model and move on to the next experiment.**

## 📊 Current Context

- **Model**: Conv1D(48,3) → BN → Dropout(0.3) → LSTM(64) → Dense(32) → Dropout(0.3) → Output(2)
- **Current Features**: 38 optimized features (up from 26 original)
- **Performance Target**: Improve combined F1 score, validation accuracy, and balanced accuracy
- **Tolerance**: 2% performance improvement threshold
- **Prediction Horizon**: 7 days out

## 🔧 Implementation Requirements

### 1. **New Indicator Integration**

- Add the new technical indicator to `FeatureCalculator.ts` in the `compute` method
- Add corresponding feature definition to `FeatureRegistry.ts`
- Ensure the indicator is added to the `optimizedFeatures` array
- Update the feature count in `FeatureDetector.ts` if needed

### 2. **Testing Process**

Use the gradual feature optimization script to test the new indicator:

```bash
# Test the new indicator specifically
npm run features:gradual -- --feature "newIndicatorName"

# Or test all features including the new one
npm run features:gradual
```

### 3. **Performance Evaluation Criteria**

Keep the new indicator if it meets ANY of these criteria:

- **Combined F1 Score**: Improves by >2%
- **Validation Accuracy**: Improves by >2%
- **Balanced Accuracy**: Improves by >2%
- **Matthews Correlation**: Improves by >2%
- **Sell F1 Score**: Improves significantly (addresses current imbalance)
