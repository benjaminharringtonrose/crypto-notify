## üìä Current Context

- **Model**: Conv1D(48,3) ‚Üí BN ‚Üí Dropout(0.3) ‚Üí LSTM(64) ‚Üí Dense(32) ‚Üí Dropout(0.3) ‚Üí Output(2)
- **Current Features**: 49 optimized features (up from 26 original)

- **Tolerance**: 2% performance improvement threshold
- **Prediction Horizon**: 7 days out
- **Model Output**: Binary classification - **BUY** (1) or **SELL** (0) decision for Bitcoin 7 days in the future

## üîß Implementation Requirements

### 1. **New Indicator Integration**

- **CRITICAL**: You must select 5 completely new technical indicators that have NOT been tested in any previous rounds
- Add the new technical indicator to `FeatureCalculator.ts` in the `compute` method
- Add corresponding feature definition to `FeatureRegistry.ts`
- Ensure the indicator is added to the `optimizedFeatures` array
- Update the feature count in `FeatureDetector.ts` if needed

### 2. **Indicator Selection Requirements**

**You must research and select 5 new indicators from the following categories that we have NOT tested:**

- **Advanced Momentum Indicators**: (e.g., Choppiness Index, Detrended Price Oscillator, Ease of Movement)
- **Advanced Volatility Indicators**: (e.g., Historical Volatility, Volatility Ratio, Volatility Index)
- **Advanced Trend Indicators**: (e.g., Trend Intensity Index, Trend Vigor, Trend Strength Index)
- **Advanced Volume Indicators**: (e.g., Volume Price Trend, Volume Rate of Change, Volume Weighted Average Price)
- **Advanced Oscillators**: (e.g., Ultimate Oscillator, Awesome Oscillator, Accelerator Oscillator)
- **Advanced Support/Resistance**: (e.g., Pivot Points, Camarilla Pivots, Woodie Pivots)
- **Advanced Price Action**: (e.g., Price Rate of Change, Price Momentum, Price Acceleration)
- **Advanced Market Microstructure**: (e.g., True Strength Index, Accumulation/Distribution Line, Price Momentum Oscillator)

**DO NOT retest any indicators from previous rounds:**

_See the comprehensive list above for all tested indicators across 14 rounds._

### 3. **Testing Process**

Use the gradual feature optimization script to test the new indicator:

```bash
# Test the new indicator specifically
npm run features:gradual -- --feature "newIndicatorName"

# Or test all features including the new one
npm run features:gradual
```

### 4. **Performance Evaluation Criteria**

Keep the new indicator if it meets ANY of these criteria:

- **Combined F1 Score**: Improves by >2%
- **Validation Accuracy**: Improves by >2%
- **Balanced Accuracy**: Improves by >2%
- **Matthews Correlation**: Improves by >2%
- **Sell F1 Score**: Improves significantly (addresses current imbalance)

**Note**: The model outputs binary predictions - **BUY** (1) when it predicts Bitcoin price will rise in 7 days, **SELL** (0) when it predicts Bitcoin price will fall in 7 days.
